readme: |-
  This `provider-packet` repository is the implementation of a Crossplane infrastructure
  [provider](https://github.com/crossplaneio/crossplane/blob/master/design/design-doc-packages.md) for
  [Packet](https://www.packet.com).
 
  The package that is built from the source code in this repository can be
  installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new
  functionality:
  
  * Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model Packet infrastructure (e.g.
  [Bare Metal](https://www.packet.com/cloud/servers/))
  * Controllers to provision these resources in Packet based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
  * Implementations of Crossplane's [portable resource abstractions](https://crossplane.io/docs/master/running-resources.html), enabling Packet resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services

overview: |-
